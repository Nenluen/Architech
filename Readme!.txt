Architect v0.0.1

Extreme prototype edition!
Written and tested with the following WAMP stack:

Windows 10 64-bit
Apache 2.4.23
MySQL 5.7.14
PHP 7.0.10

Config.php is all you need to edit, depending on your particular SQL setup.

Upon creating your first user account a 'storyteller' account is generated with '1a2b3c4d5e' as the password.  Your players can read this document too, change that before you publish the ip to everyone.

No Drop table commands are used in this code, if your DB gets eaten, its not because of Architect.
